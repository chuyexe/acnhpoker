## Troubleshooting

*If you are using Kosmos "Defaults" SD setup, some Sys Modules are known to cause problem with the in-game inventroy addresses.
Please avoid choosing "sys-clk", "sys-ftpd-light", "sys-con" or "ldn_mitm" in the SD packages.
If you are not sure, please use "Minimal" instead.

*Edizon is also known to cause problems, deactivating the module may help, though deleting Edizon and it's overlays is recommended

*If images will not install, click the small grey box in the top right corner, that is there incase the original download button does not funtion.
